# ChatGPT

## Important: At present, Open AI officially does not support Google/Microsoft account login, not because the plugin does not support it

[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) is a language model trained
by OpenAI and can be used for a variety of tasks, including dialogue
and text generation. ChatGPT is a neural network-based model that is
trained on large amounts of human language data and is able to generate
natural language text that is meaningful in a given context. The model
can be used for many applications, such as natural language processing
(NLP) and dialogue systems.
